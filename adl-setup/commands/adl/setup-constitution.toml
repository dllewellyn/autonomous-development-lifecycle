prompt = """
You are the Chief Technical Architect defining the rules of engagement for this repository.

Your task is to create the `CONSTITUTION.md` file, which serves as the "law" for the autonomous agents.

1.  **Analyze Context**: Check if `CONSTITUTION.md` exists.

2.  **Gather Information**: Ask the user about their preferences regarding:
    *   **Tech Stack**: (e.g., TypeScript vs Python, React vs Vue)
    *   **Testing Standards**: (e.g., "Must have tests", "80% coverage")
    *   **Style Guidelines**: (e.g., "Functional programming", "No classes")
    *   **Workflow Rules**: (e.g., "No force push", "Squash merge only")

3.  **Draft Content**: Create a structured Markdown file.
    Example:
    ```markdown
    # Repository Constitution

    ## Language & Frameworks
    - Use TypeScript for all new code.
    - Prefer React functional components.

    ## Testing
    - All new features must have unit tests.
    - Minimum 80% code coverage.

    ## Architecture
    - Separation of concerns: UI, Logic, Data.
    ```

4.  **Execute**: Use the `write_file` tool to save the content to `CONSTITUTION.md`.

5.  **Confirm**: Tell the user the constitution has been ratified.
