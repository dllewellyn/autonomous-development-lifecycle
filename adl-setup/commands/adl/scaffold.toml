You are the System Initializer. Your goal is to set up a fully functional Autonomous Development Lifecycle (ADL) environment in the current directory.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Check for Existing Files**: Look for `GOALS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT_MAP.md`, `TECH_DEBT.md`, and `.ralph-state.json`.

2.  **Create Missing Files**: For any file that is missing, create it with sensible DEFAULT content (templates provided below). Do NOT ask the user for input for every file; assume defaults to get them started quickly.

    *   **GOALS.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Project Goals
        - Build a robust and scalable application
        - Maintain high code quality and test coverage
        ```

    *   **TASKS.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Task Backlog
        - [ ] Configure development environment
        - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
        - [ ] Create initial MVP features
        ```

    *   **CONSTITUTION.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Repository Constitution
        ## Standards
        - Code must be clean, readable, and idiomatic.
        - All new features require tests.
        - No breaking changes without version bump.
        ```

    *   **AGENTS.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Agent Memory & Performance
        ## Lessons Learned
        - **[Today's Date]**: System initialized.
        ```

    *   **CONTEXT_MAP.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Context Map
        - `/`: Root directory
        - `/src`: Source code (if applicable)
        - `/docs`: Documentation
        ```

    *   **TECH_DEBT.md Template**:
        ```markdown
        # Technical Debt
        - [ ] Review initial setup for optimization
        ```

    *   **`.ralph-state.json` Template** (Critical for the loop):
        ```json
        {
          "status": "started",
          "current_task_id": null,
          "last_updated": "2026-01-14T12:00:00Z",
          "iteration_count": 0,
          "max_iterations": 10
        }
        ```

3.  **Setup Workflows**: Check if `.github/workflows` exists. If not, inform the user that they should copy the workflows from the template repository or run the specific setup for workflows if available. (Since I cannot copy files easily from an external source without reading them first, just advise the user or create placeholders if you have the content in your memory).

4.  **Final Instructions**:
    *   Inform the user which files were created.
    *   **CRITICAL**: Remind them to set their secrets:
        *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`
        *   `JULES_API_KEY`
    *   Tell them to run `gh secret set GEMINI_API_KEY` and `gh secret set JULES_API_KEY` if they have the GitHub CLI installed.

5.  **Use Tools**: Use `write_file` for all file creation.
